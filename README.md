# Metal-Detector
An embedded system-based metal detector using a 555 Timer IC, microcontroller (Arduino/STM32), and buzzer for real-time metal detection. This project integrates circuit design, frequency analysis, and PCB layout to detect metal objects by measuring frequency shifts caused by inductance variations.
